            <p>

For as long as I can remember, I've been captivated by the intricacies of the human body and the world of Medical Biochemistry. My days were filled with lab experiments, analyzing data, and learning about the complexities of biology. But in November 2024, I took an unexpected turn in my career path and decided to dive into the world of coding, a choice that has since ignited a passion I never anticipated.</p>
<h2><b>My Journey</b></h2>

<p>Although my background in Medical Biochemistry involved meticulous science and problem-solving, I found myself wanting something more. The idea of creating technology that could genuinely improve lives piqued my interest, so I decided to teach myself coding from the ground up. It wasn't easy at first, there were plenty of sleepless nights and moments of doubt, but the excitement of building something from scratch kept me going.
By February 2025, I felt ready to put my newfound skills to work. I started developing my first projects, each one more personal than the last. My first app, CycleMe, is a period tracking tool designed to help people monitor their cycles, health, and moods. Then came Checkmate, a task management app that keeps users organized and productive. 
Lastly, I created CalSEA, an emergency app designed to provide discreet, fast help in critical situations. Each of these projects was not just a learning experience but a way for me to combine my desire for problem-solving with a genuine purpose.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>

<p>What began as a random decision has quickly become a passion that drives me every day. Each project pushes me further into the world of tech, and I can't wait to continue learning and creating. My journey proves that it's never too late to follow a new path, no matter where you start, and I'm excited for the opportunities ahead!</p>

        title: "My First Month as a Woman in Tech",
        content: `
            <p>From CSS struggles to my first JavaScript click event, the journey is messy but exciting. Every bug solved 
            gives me the confidence to keep pushing!</p>
            
<p>This past month, I've been building my very first portfolio website, a space to showcase what I've been learning and creating. It started as a simple idea: a clean, personal site where I could introduce myself, share my projects, and maybe even write a few posts. But of course, nothing about coding is ever as simple as it sounds.
One of my biggest early frustrations? A missing “s.” For hours, I couldn't figure out why my styles weren't loading and my JavaScript wasn't running. I triple-checked my code, restructured my files, and almost convinced myself I had broken something beyond repair, only to discover I had written style.css instead of styles.css, and post.js instead of posts.js. That one tiny character had been holding everything back.</p>
<p>When I fixed it and refreshed the page, everything just clicked into place. I can't even explain the joy, I was elated. It's wild how something so small can make or break an entire site, and how empowering it feels when you figure it out yourself.</p>
<h2><b>In a Nutshell</b></h2>
<p>This portfolio has become more than just a personal project. It's been a hands-on classroom, a testing ground, and a huge confidence booster. Every broken link and console error has taught me something new, and every fix reminds me that I can do this. I've still got a lot to learn, but if this first month has taught me anything, it's that the smallest victories in tech feel like the biggest wins.</p>

        title: "Balancing Life, Learning & Code",
        content:`
        <p>Between family chaos, self-doubt, and sleepless nights, coding has become my sanctuary. Here's how I'm learning to balance it all while still chasing my tech dreams.</P>
        
        <p>Let's be real, this journey hasn't been easy. My days are a blur of responsibilities, questions from family, and the weight of trying to prove myself. My parents have made it very clear: they'd prefer I stop “wasting time” and focus on finding a traditional job. They don't really see coding as a “real” career, at least, not yet.</p>
        <p>And I get it. They just want security for me. But I also know that I've found something I genuinely care about. Coding has become my safe space. A place where I can be creative, make mistakes, and solve problems at my own pace. I may not have all the answers yet, but I do have a plan.</p>
        <p>Right now, I carve out four focused hours every day, sometimes early in the morning, sometimes way past midnight. It's not always easy, especially when the house is buzzing with distractions and doubt, but those hours are sacred. They're where I push through tutorials, build out projects, and sharpen my skills one line of code at a time.</p>
        <h2><b>In Conclusion</b></h2>
        <p>I'm not doing this just for me; I'm doing it to show them that coding is a viable path. That this passion of mine can open doors, land jobs, and create opportunities they never imagined. Soon, I'll land that first role. And when I do, I'll be able to say I earned it not just through code, but through resilience, belief, and a whole lot of hustle.</P>
