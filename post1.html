            For as long as I can remember, I've been a woman in science. But lately, tech has stolen my heart. Coding 
            feels like building superpowers from scratch, and I'm ready to take this journey head-on.

            Being a woman in tech can feel intimidating, but it also feels like home. Every line of code is a step closer 
            to the future I want for myself.
